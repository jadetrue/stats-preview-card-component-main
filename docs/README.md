## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Sass & BEM)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about positioning an overlay on this project and that there are multiple ways to achieve the same result. Also, I'm expanding my knowlegde on Grid and Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Overlay Help](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21086385/how-to-make-in-css-an-overlay-over-an-image) - This helped me to understand what elements I needed to have the correct properties against. I found this really useful.
